# Scripts

This folder contains reusable Python scripts that support the thesis analysis workflow. Each script is designed to perform a specific task and can be imported into Jupyter notebooks for modular, reproducible execution.

### Contents

- `thesis_government_preparedness_analysis.py`  
  Contains functions for classifying disaster events into preparedness levels based on severity thresholds and international response indicators. Also includes logic for calculating and exporting preparedness indices by country and region.

- `thesis_human_rights_protection_analysis.py`  
  Includes functions for mapping disaster subtypes to human rights, exploding multi-right events, preparing rights impact datasets, and performing clustering and regression analysis.

> These scripts are referenced in the main analysis notebooks in the `/notebooks` folder and are used to automate key parts of the analytical pipeline.
