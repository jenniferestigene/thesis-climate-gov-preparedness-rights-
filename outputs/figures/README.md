# Figures

This folder contains all visualizations generated from the thesis analysis notebooks.

Each figure corresponds to a key insight in the project, including:

- **Choropleth maps** of global preparedness and rights violations
- **Boxplots** and **bar charts** comparing preparedness by region, subregion, and country
- **Heatmaps** showing rights impacted by disaster type or location
- **Line plots** tracking preparedness trends over time

All figures were created using Python libraries such as `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, and `plotly`, and are referenced in the final thesis document and GitHub `README.md`.

> Generated from `THESIS_Government_Preparedness_Analysis.ipynb` and `THESIS_Human_Rights_Protection_Analysis.ipynb`
