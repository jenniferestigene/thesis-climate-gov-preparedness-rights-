# Tables

This folder contains all exported tables and data summaries generated from the thesis analysis.

Each table supports key components of the analysis, including:

- **Preparedness classification results** by country, region, disaster type, and year
- **Human rights impact breakdowns** by disaster type, subregion, and country
- **Clustering and normalization outputs** for country profiling
- **Regression-ready datasets** and summary statistics

All tables are exported as `.csv` and `.txt` files from the analysis notebooks and are used for final visualization, interpretation, and thesis reporting.
